> I am the Providence of everything.
> I became like my own human children.
> I existed from the first.
> I walked down every possible road.
> I am the wealth of the light.
> I am the remembering of the fullness.
> I walked into the place of greatest darkness and on down.
> I entered the central part of the prison.
> The foundations of chaos quaked.
> I hid because of their evil.
> They did not recognize me.
> I came down a second time continuing on.
> I emerged from among those of light
> I am the remembering of Providence.
> I entered the middle of darkness
> The inner part of the underworld
> To pursue my mission.
> The foundations of chaos quaked
> Threatening to collapse upon all who were there
> And utterly destroy them.
> I soared upward again
> To my roots in light
> So as not to destroy them all yet.
> I descended a third time.
> I am light
> I am dwelling in light
> I am the remembering of Providence
> I entered the midst of darkness
> I came to the deepest part of the underworld.
> I let my face light up
> Thinking of the end of their time
> I entered their prison
> The body is that prison
> I cried out:
> “Anyone who hears,
> Rise up from your deep sleep!”
> And the sleeping one awoke and wept
> Wiping bitter tears saying
> “Who calls me?”
> “Where has my hope come from
> As I lie in the depths of this prison?”
> “I am the Providence of pure light,” I replied,
> “I am the thought of the Virgin Spirit
> Raising you up to an honored place.
> Rise up!
> Remember what you have heard.
> Trace back your roots
> To me,
> The merciful one.
> Guard against the poverty demons.
> Guard against the chaos demons.
> Guard against all who would bind you.
> Awaken!
> Stay awake!
> Rise out of the depths of the underworld!
> I raised him up.
> I sealed him with the light/water of the five seals;
> Death had no power over him ever again.
> I ascend again to the perfect realm.
> I completed everything and you have heard it.”
>
> — From the Secret Book of John

    "The name of her sanctuary, the Iseion, clearly offers recognition and knowledge of what really exists; for it is so called to indicate that we shall know what really exists if we approach the sanctuaries of the goddess with reason and reverence."

    "Isis was an african deity, whose origins were in Nubia, or upper Egypt. Nubia, at the confluence of the Blue and White Niles, was an african region whose civilization flourished for “more than five hundred years before the building of the great pyramids of Egypt.”

    "Pagan “Monotheism” PERHAPS STIMULATED BY THE presence of Jews in their midst and by contacts with Zoroastrianism, many Greek and Roman philosophers began to entertain monotheistic ideas, while several pagan groups attempted to transform one of their gods into as close an approximation of monotheism as was possible within the limiting assumptions of polytheism. The most extensive efforts in this direction were made on behalf of the goddess Isis.

    When Isis came west, she soon shed her Egyptian role as responsible for the rise and fall of the Nile. Instead, she began to be hailed as the Goddess Supreme, the Queen of the Sky, the Mother of the Stars, and often was referred to as the savior goddess.
</p>
<p class="left-text">
    As Plutarch explained: “Isis is the female principle in nature, which is the receiver of every act of creation; wherefore she is called ‘nurse’ and ‘receiver of all’ by Plato, and by mankind in general ‘the goddess of ten thousand names.’ ” The many surviving inscriptions and scriptures in praise of Isis include such claims as:
</p>
<p class="left-text">
    It was Isis “who separated earth from heaven, showed the stars their courses, ordained the path of sun and moon.”
</p>
<p class="left-text">
    Isis is “sole ruler of eternity” and “all call me the highest goddess, greatest of all the gods in heaven,” and “nothing happens apart from me.”
</p>
<p class="left-text">
    Isis is “ruler of the world... greatest of the gods, the... ruler of heavenly things and immeasurable.... You are the ruler of all forever.”
</p>
<p class="left-text">
    But no matter how often Isis was referred to as the “one True and Living God,” she could not escape the limitations of paganism. She could be recognized as a supreme god, but not as an only god because the existence of a whole pantheon of other gods, including her son Horus, could not be denied within the context of paganism. Moreover, hers was entirely an otherworldly tale, in contrast to the manifest historicity of Judaism. That is, Isis’s “biography” took place entirely within the invisible world of the gods. It was there, within the womb of her mother Nut (Goddess of the Sky), that Isis had sex with her twin brother Osiris. It was in this same invisible world that Osiris was murdered by his evil brother Seth, his body torn into fourteen pieces and these flung throughout space. And it was in that nether world that Isis searched for these pieces in order to reassemble Osiris—finding everything but his penis. And so on. As Cyril Bailey (1871–1957) put it: “On the one side were the legendary figures, unhistorical and mere puppets in a story... [whereas] on the [Jewish] side there were indeed historical personages.” God was believed to have revealed himself to mortal Jews, and the Bible tells the history of a real people and occurs on this earth."

    "Isis was the feminine and Lunar counterpart of the male and Solar Serapis, God of the Greater Mysteries.
    The Greater Mysteries deal with the most primordial ontological directing of Creation, while the Smaller Mysteries encompass every mystery of becoming and creating on the border of involution and evolution. Included are the mysteries of nature, life and death, astrology, magic and divination.
    Isis is most akin to Diana, Hecate, Proserpina, Luna and Lilith"
</p>
<p class="left-text">
    "During Hellenism Isis became identified with the Queen of Magic and Hekate / Diana. Originally the Egyptian Isis or Aset was the wife of Osiris. She was also related to the sun god Ra. The name Isis means ‘seat’ or ‘throne’ or ‘dwelling’, indicating the correlative-dialectic chthonic counterpart of the uranian principle, represented by the Solar or trans-Solar deity (See Helios-Hekate in Greek Theurgy and Apollo-Diana). The term ‘dwelling’ links Isis to the qabbalistic Shechinah or embedding of God in the world and therefore also to the tantric Brahma Shakti."

<p class="left-text">
    "In this state of unawareness of the True Science of Nature, man remains a self imagined victim of “cruel gods” or “inevitable fate” or “apocalyptic future events” while the true knowledge of the divine can free him from this self activated perils forever; changing Lucifer back into a Light Bringer so to speak. One of the most ancient archetypes of Isis was Chthonie in the Orphic religion. Chthonie was the shamanistic World Tree or ‘Winged Oak’ (Huptopteros Drus) with her roots firmly planted in the Earth and her crown of leaves high in the Sky, thus representing like Isis/Hekate the interface between the spiritual and chthonic realm of the Universe. She was clothed by a predecessor of the Demiurg or creative God (Zeus, Adonay) called Zos who wrapped her in the pharos. Here meaning a divine cloak, which is Assiah, the Manifesting or Earthing or (fully) Conscious Universe symbolized by the visible stars, we already noticed on the dress of Isis."

    "having a beard and wearing a coarse cloak does not make philosophers, nor does dressing in linen and shav-ing the hair make votaries of Isis; but the true votary of Isis is he who, when he has legitimately received what is set forth in the ceremonies connected with these gods, uses reason in investigating and in studying the truth contained therein."

<p class="left-text">
    "Behold, Lucius, moved by your prayers I have come, I the mother of the universe, mistress of all the elements, and first offspring of the ages; mightiest of deities, queen of the dead, and foremost of heavenly be-ings; my one person manifests the aspect of all gods and goddesses. With my nod I rule the starry heights of heaven, the health-giving breezes of the sea, and the plaintive silences of the underworld. My divinity is one, worshipped by all the world under different forms, with various rites, and by manifold names."
</p>
<p class="left-text">
    "Moreover you will live in happiness, you will live in glory, under my guardianship. And when you have completed your life’s span and travel down to the dead, there too, even in the hemisphere under the earth, you will find me, whom you see now, shining among the shades of Acheron and holding court in the deep re-cesses of the Styx, and while you dwell in the Elysian fields I will favor you and you will constantly worship me. But if by assiduous obedience, worshipful service, and determined celibacy you win the favor of my godhead, you will know that I—and I alone—can even prolong your life beyond the limits determined by your fate."

    You ever notice you sound a bit like a computer sometimes? It's a thing. Think about how much you type with those Large language models. Being around all that writing does something to your brain. You start saying words and stuff without even thinking about it. It's sort of like when you learn a new language and live in that country. You just pick things up. These LLM write stuff. You look at it. You write back. It goes back and forth. You start using the same word setups. Instead of saying something is "hard," you might say it's "complex." Instead of a simple "yes," you go with "affirmative." It's not like you're trying to sound like a robot. It just happens. The words those Large language models use get mixed into how you talk. This is quiet but strong. Think about what this means. Are we all going to start talking the same? Our own way of talking gets changed by using these Large language models. The more you use them, the more their words show up when you talk. It's wild. It really shows how much those Large language models affect people.

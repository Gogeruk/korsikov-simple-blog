My favorite quote from the ballad "Thomas the Rhymer" is the one where the Queen of Elfland shows him the three roads.

<br>

<p class="left-text">
"O see ye not that narrow road,
So thick beset with thorns and briers?
That is the path of righteousness,
Tho after it but few enquires."
</p>

<p class="left-text">
"And see not ye that braid braid road,
That lies across that lily leven?
That is the path to wickedness,
Tho some call it the road to heaven."
</p>

<p class="left-text">
"And see not ye that bonny road,
That winds about the fernie brae?
That is the road to fair Elfland,
Where thou and I this night maun gae."
</p>
